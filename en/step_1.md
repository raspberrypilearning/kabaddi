## What you will make

Make a game inspired by [kabaddi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi), where the player must cross a line, tag opponents, and avoid being caught, while managing a countdown timer by repeatedly pressing the space bar.

### Rules:
- Use the arrow keys to tag opponents.
- Opponents will chase you, but cannot cross the green line.
- You can only touch one opponent at a time. If you touch more than one opponent at a time, they have caught you and you will lose a life.
- You must press the space bar **at least once every second** or you will lose a life.
